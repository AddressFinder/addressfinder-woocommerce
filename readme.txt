Prevent failed deliveries and streamline checkout with verified address autocomplete for shipping and billing addresses in Australian and New Zealand WooCommerce stores.

== Description ==

Prevent costly shipping errors and failed deliveries with [Addressfinder](https://addressfinder.com/?utm_source=woocommerce&utm_medium=plugin_listing&utm_campaign=woocommerce_listing&utm_term=addressfinder); Australia and New Zealand’s leading address autocomplete and verification provider.

The Addressfinder plugin for WooCommerce adds verified address autocomplete capability to the shipping and billing address fields of your online store. 

The plugin suggests verified addresses to your customers as they type and auto-fills the correct address elements into the appropriate fields on selection.

The addresses are validated before customers place their order, ensuring accurate address entry, a streamlined purchase process, and reduced delivery issues.

= Get verified addresses =

No more mistakes. The Addressfinder address database is the most comprehensive address dataset in Australia and New Zealand with support for international addresses in over 15 countries.

Other services such as Google autocomplete just suggests addresses and often don't provide accurate PO Box or unit and level number addresses which make up ~37% of all Australian postal addresses. Addressfinder makes it easy, handling local complexities and only displaying addresses that local carriers such as Australia Post and NZ Post accept - so every package gets delivered. 

= Access the latest addresses =

The Addressfinder address database is refreshed monthly so you can rely on the data being available and up to date. Our extensive data sources provide us with the freshest data so customers living in new developments or multi-dwelling apartments will still be able to validate their addresses.

= Built-in email and phone verification =

Don't let a customer slip between the cracks due to a spelling error. Our email and phone verification widgets allow you to collect valid data in the format you require, maintaining your data quality and sender reputation.
Simple visual cues ensure your customers provide only valid contact information while they are actively engaged on your website.

= No programming required =

This plugin is easy to set up. It does not require any coding experience and you can have it working and validating addresses in minutes.

= Reduce time to checkout =

Our address autocomplete greatly reduces data entry time and potential for errors. Users can be sure their address is correct and move through to the checkout quickly and with confidence.

= Enhance mobile UX =

User experience is critical to conversion rate. By using Addressfinder, your checkout experience is made simple for users inputting fields, greatly reducing required keystrokes on small mobile keyboards. Our plugin is responsive and friendly across popular devices and browsers.
